# FocusFlow
A lightweight ADHD support app mockup (BME 450)

This is a clickable prototype to show the main flow: plan → start → stay on track → reflect.

We let the user type what they want to do in plain language. The AI then breaks it into small, concrete steps and suggests a realistic schedule. If the user falls behind, the AI adjusts the plan instead of keeping an unrealistic to-do list.

## Quick actions

<div style="display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:12px; margin: 14px 0;">
  <a href="start-session" style="padding:10px 14px; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px; text-decoration:none;">Start a focus session</a>
  <a href="tasks" style="padding:10px 14px; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px; text-decoration:none;">My tasks</a>
  <a href="stuck" style="padding:10px 14px; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px; text-decoration:none;">I’m stuck</a>
  <a href="insights" style="padding:10px 14px; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px; text-decoration:none;">Insights</a>

## Today (example)
- Top priority: Finish lab report draft
- Next step: Open report doc and write the Methods outline
- Focus goal: 2 sessions (25 min each)

## What this app is trying to solve
Many planning tools stop at “make a list.” FocusFlow focuses on:
- getting you started with a tiny next step
- keeping you on track with light check-ins
- making progress visible with simple summaries
- re-planning automatically when things don’t go as planned

---

## How AI fits in
- Task breakdown: turn “Finish lab report” into a short, doable checklist.
- Schedule rescue: if a task isn’t completed, suggest a smaller next step and reshuffle the rest of the day/week without punishment.
- Optional “stuck” help: offer one concrete action to restart.
