# FocusFlow
A lightweight ADHD support app mockup (BME 450)

This is a clickable prototype to show the main flow: plan → start → stay on track → reflect.

FocusFlow uses simple AI to (1) break big tasks into clear next steps, and (2) adapt your plan when you fall behind, so the schedule stays realistic instead of turning into guilt.

## Quick actions

<div style="display:flex; flex-wrap:wrap; gap:12px; margin: 14px 0;">
  <a href="start-session.md" style="padding:10px 14px; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px; text-decoration:none;">Start a focus session</a>
  <a href="tasks.md" style="padding:10px 14px; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px; text-decoration:none;">My tasks</a>
  <a href="stuck.md" style="padding:10px 14px; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px; text-decoration:none;">I’m stuck</a>
  <a href="insights.md" style="padding:10px 14px; border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:10px; text-decoration:none;">Insights</a>

## Today (example)
- Top priority: Finish lab report draft
- Next step: Open report doc and write the Methods outline
- Focus goal: 2 sessions (25 min each)

## What this app is trying to solve
Many planning tools stop at “make a list.” FocusFlow focuses on:
- getting you started with a tiny next step
- keeping you on track with light check-ins
- making progress visible with simple summaries
- re-planning automatically when things don’t go as planned

---

## How AI fits in (high level)
- Task breakdown: turn “Finish lab report” into a short, doable checklist.
- Schedule rescue: if a task isn’t completed, suggest a smaller next step and reshuffle the rest of the day/week without punishment.
- Optional “stuck” help: offer one concrete action to restart momentum.
